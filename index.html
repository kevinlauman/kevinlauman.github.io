				<p>Hello! My name is Kevin and I am a lover of all things outdoors. I particularly enjoy exploring the
					backcountry and experiencing nature in its raw form. The solitude and peace that comes with being away from
					civilization is something I treasure. When I'm not out in the wilderness, I enjoy woodworking and creating
					beautiful pieces of furniture or other crafts.</a></p>
				<p>I am currently seeking my next career adventure as a Scrum Master or Agile Coach. I am passionate about
					helping teams work efficiently and effectively, and I believe that the agile framework is a powerful tool for
					achieving success. I am eager to learn and grow in this role, and I believe that my skills and experiences
					will make me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
				<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. </p>
